# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview;

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company to develop a machine learning to model to identify credit risk of potential/fututure applicants. This is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, hence we will test a few different machine learning calssfication models to improve our prediction of the high risk applicants. 

## Results:

In our data at a high level, we have data in the following categories:

    low_risk     68470 

    high_risk      347

### Logistic Regression
